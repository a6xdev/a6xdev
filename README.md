Hello, my name is Aislan. I am passionate about games, motorsports and stories.

Since I was a child, I wanted to work in game development, so I started my studies to get into 3D Art. But I ended up meeting a very special person who made me change fields and found my new passion, programming.

I invested my time learning Godot long before it became what it is today. I hope it is worth it... fortunately I am quite flexible and learn very quickly :)
