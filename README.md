## Hello
Hello, my name is Aislan. I'm passionate about games, motorsports, fiction and especially horror.

## About Me
Since I was a child, I wanted to work in game development, so I started my studies to get into 3D Art. But I ended up meeting a very special person who made me change fields and found my new passion, programming.

I spent my time learning Godot long before it became so famous and I love seeing what it has become today.
